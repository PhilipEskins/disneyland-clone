# Disneyland Clone

#### _Application for Disneyland Clone, Last Updated 03-31-2019_

#### By _**Philip Eskins**_

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.7.

## Description

_This application is my attempt at recreating www.disneyland.com._

## Process
###### Sunday 3/31/19
_After some research and soul searching I found the answer for the nav bar issue and was able to progress with the next section. The nav bar isn't completely finished at this time, only the last one for "My Disneyland" does the correct drop down, but its easy to replicate for the others._

_I also added the video on the page along with the "Plan your Vacation" bar and some text on top of the video. Feel more confident about this project now. Though I think this will take longer then the few weeks we have to work on it. In the future the buttons for "Plan my Vacation" will allow you to add more people to your party._

###### Friday 3/29/19
_Spent 8 hours on this project on Friday 3/29/2019. In that time I got the basic framework up for the nav bar and then ran into a major issue with the dropdown function of the nav bar. Fell into the imposter syndrome blackhole._
