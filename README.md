This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.7.

## Description

_This application is my attempt at recreating www.disneyland.com._

## Process
_I originally dove head first into this project without much thought because I believed I could replicate the landing page at least pretty easily. After getting part of the navbar done I realized it was quite a bit more complicated then I originally thought. Currently the clone is a major work in progress._
